# TODOs & Future Features

* Re-implement proper display of text snippet previews (plus
  correct behavior of the JSON `snippet` field).
* Revise hull computation (less smoothing, use original geometry
  when hull is only based on a single place).
* Proper handling of dataset objects. (Also think about what to
  do when a dataset is selected from the search result list.)
* Support PeriodO periods.
* Timeslider touch Support.
* Timeslider: 1AD marker overlap issue (when interval boundary
  is close to 1AD).
* Timeslider: general visibility of current interval setting?
* 'You have filters' warning icon (plus button to clear all
  filters at once?)
* Filter editor popup: replace current X icon with checkmark + X
  icon for 'Accept'/'Cancel' functionality.
* Help window (also document search syntax - prefix, fuzzy,
  booleans).
* Proper 404 page.
* Wait spinners all over.
* Clean up custom icons (roll everything into an icon font).
* How to handle objects contained in Ren√©'s gazetteer?
* __BUG:__ orphaned selection marker.
